      <h2><u>My Hair Evolution Post-Chemotherapy</u> üíáüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h2>
      <h5>Health Updates ‚Ä¢ May 27, 2022</h5>
      <img src="hair.jpg" alt="Hair"width="700" height="250">
      <p>Being able to reflect on this topic took a while because I used to hate how I looked‚Äîpale and bald. I couldn't even believe that was me. Being able to look in the mirror and be okay with it took a lot of self reflection and patience. I kept asking myself "How fast will my hair grow back?" Searching online and talking to past cancer survivors gave me a rough estimate as to when but apparently everybody's hair grows at different rates. </p>
      <p>Below is an approximate timeline as to how fast my hair grew back post-chemotherapy.</p>
      <ul><b>3 weeks post-chemo</b>: My hair was growing only on the side‚Äîkind of weird...</ul>
      <ul><b>6 weeks post-chemo</b>: I have a visible hairline now from all my peach fuzz.</ul>
      <ul><b>10 weeks post-chemo</b>: Enough hair to be messy, but my sides are still longer than the top.</ul>
      <ul><b>12 weeks post-chemo</b>: My first haircut to even out the mess.</ul>
      <p>From there, it's what you can expect. I let it grow out and actually really liked having the short hair length. I wasn't brave enough to try a Pixie cut until now. I also applied a few things on my hair to accelerate hair growth. The best things that worked for me were to apply coconut oil and tea tree oil on my scalp every night. In addition to products, your diet is extremely important so I ate many greens to give my body as many vitamins and nutrients it needed.</p>
      <p>For the people who are going through it, I know it's tough. I used to wear a beanie or pull up my sweatshirt hoodie so no one could see my bare scalp, but I learned to get past that. Mirror were an obstacle for a while, but it gets better. This is a temporary state and hair always grows!</p>

      <h2><u>Healing Benefits of Soursop Tea</u> üçµ</h2>
      <h5>Healing Tips ‚Ä¢ May 10, 2022</h5>
      <img src="soursop.jpg" alt="Hair"width="700" height="350">
      <p>Can Soursop really heal cancer? We don't know yet, but it's a great source of antioxidants due to the array of annonaceous acetogenins (AGE) which are a unique class of metabolites derived from a long fatty acid chain. There has been positive studies done in animals, but not humans just yet. The reason I drink it is because I want to boost my immune system to help my body repair itself from everything it's been through, fight off inflammation, relax, and the possibility that it may have healing affects. Because of its use as a sedative, I usually drink it before I go to bed to help me go to sleep.</p>
      <p>Although there are some articles about the fact that this fruit could lead to other diseases, from research that's only if you consume a lot of it all the time which isn't the case for me‚Äîand shouldn't be the case for you. I only drink it twice a week. My recipe is down below.
      <ul>Boil 1 liter of water.</ul>
      <ul>Add 7 Soursop leaves.</ul>
      <ul>Keep pot covered and simmer for 15 minutes.</ul>
      <ul>Add lemon and honey.</ul>
      <p>I also want to point out that I've read and talked to many people about Soursop tea and many say that it has helped them heal, so don't give up hope...</p>

      <h2><u>The Power of Hope</u> ü§ûüèΩ</h2>
      <h5>Talks ‚Ä¢ April 28, 2022</h5>
      <img src="hope.jpg" alt="Hair"width="700" height="350">
      <p>A large part of my life is confiding in my oncologist. But, at the same time, I don't really know him that well. It was normal for us to barely have a conversation and have his back turned to me as he typed on his computer while I asked him questions. I though this was normal because perhaps he didn't want to give me a false sense of hope.</p>
      <p>I recently went to a conference and I was blown away with how open this speaker's doctor was with her. They even texted each other! The speaker talked about how much her relationship with her doctor made a huge difference in her healing and that made me realize that's what I needed right now. I am so grateful for my oncologist's help and his intelligence, but I need this in order to get better. It has been proven that whatever we experience in our mind, we experience in our body. Emotions affect our health‚Äîpyschoneruoimmunology. It's like that phenomenon where if you smile even if you aren't happy, your body will think you are happy releasing certain chemicals which end up making you feel better than you did before.</p>

      <h2><u>April Health Update</u> üò∑</h2>
      <h5>Health Updates ‚Ä¢ April 10, 2022</h5>
      <img src="april.jpg" alt="Hair"width="700" height="350">
      <p>I sort of wanted to open up on how I figured out I have breast cancer because I know many of you reading probably have experienced something similar.</p>
      <p>I'm standing in front of mirror, getting ready for bed. I take off my bra and notice something peculiar with my breasts. Feeling around, there was a very small, about marble sized, lump where there was creasing. I wasn't really anxious because breasts change with my cycle. I thought it was nothing though, so I decided to see if with time it went away. Why would I go to the doctor for such a small thing? After a week it was still there and it felt painful, so I decided to go see a doctor because by then it was larger than normal and it felt harder.</p>
      <p>My mom's side has a history of having breast cancer, so obviously I was a bit nervous when thinking about the possibility of it being that. I wanted to get tested when I finished high school, but it's incredibly expensive at about $4,000. This BRCA gene test is a blood test that determines if there are mutations in my DNA that increase the risk of breast cancer. However, most breast cancer cases aren't hereditary‚Äîonly about 5% to 10%. But, the one that my mom and her mom had were BRCA 2 which is one of the most common inheredited breast cancer.</p>

      <h5>Travels ‚Ä¢ March 30, 2022</h5>
      <img src="madrid.jpg" alt="Hair"width="700" height="250">
      <p>You won't believe it. I went on a healing retreat to Madrid, Spain. Healing retreats are one of the most important things that I've done in the past 5 years. Although I was only there for 1 week, it was the most relaxing experience I've had in what feels like forever. On my schedule was Yoga twice a day along with classes for myofascial relase. Both of which are great ways to activate the immune system. Along with other cancer survivors, we participating in sharing circles, hiked, and learned about fresh herbs that are proven to heal. In addition to leaning about cancer related things, we ate so much delicious food. The people I connected with are also so genuine.</p>
      <p>After returning from Spain, I had a blood test to monitor my treatment on Ibrance. Before leaving for Spain, my neutrophils were at 0.4. My oncologist said I should stop taking Ibrance because my numbers would continue to lower. However, after returning from my trip, I was at 1.5 which is higher than I've seen in a very long time since I've been below 1 since taking Ibrance. Therefore, it's really important to prioritize things and foods that will help your immune system. I fully believe that yoga and myofascial release were key to explaining these numbers. If you want to join another retreat, there is another one happening on Greece's famous island, Crete, soon so check that out.</p>
